/*
Item delivery needs to take place for a circle of size B. Suppose we start from the position C (given) then find the position where the Ath item will be delivered.

Note: Distribution of Items are performed at the adjacent positions starting from C. 
Expected Input: Three integers A, B, C
Expected Output: Integer denoting the position of the delivery of the Ath item if started from position C.
