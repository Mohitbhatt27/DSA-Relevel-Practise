/*==, ===, !===, !==
misconception: that == does not check the type and just compares the value. It's not like that. 

== is an Abstract Equality Comparison, it first checks the type of both operand, if Type(x) == Type(y),
then the whole thing is transfered to === which is a Strict Equality comaparison. 

if the types are not same in ==, it does coercion
