//The let declaration declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

// let x = 1;
// if (x === 1) {
//   let x = 2;
//   console.log(x); // expected output: 2
// }
// console.log(x); // expected output: 1

/*The other difference between var and let is that the 
let is initialized to a value only when a parser evaluates it
Many issues with let variables can be avoided by declaring them 
at the top of the scope in which they are used
Unlike var, let begins declarations, not statements. 
That means you cannot use a lone let declaration as the body of a block 
(which makes sense, since there's no way to access the variable).*/

Variables declared by let have their scope in the block for which they are declared,

  The if block is evaluated because the outer var foo has a value.

  it is still in the temporal dead zone.
