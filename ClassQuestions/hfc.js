/* 
optimised solution of gcd comes from Euclid's algorithm
if we divide 2 numbers a and b, then a=b*q+r where r is the remainder and q is the quotient
a=19, b=7, then 19=7*2+5; when q=2, r=5;

let's say gcd of a and b is g, then g is the largest number which completely divides a and b
that means a%g=b%g=0
now we have a=bq+r
a-bq=r
bq will also be divisible by g, since b and a both are divisble by g
bq is a multiple of b
that means whole a-bq is divisible by g
and a-bq is divisble by g
this implies r is also divisble by g
and we know that r is going to be lesser than a and b
so we may say gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,a%b) where a%b is the remainder
this is euclid algorithm
