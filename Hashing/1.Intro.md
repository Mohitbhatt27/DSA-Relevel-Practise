### Hashing

Hashing is a techniue used for storing and retrieving information as quickly as possible.

- used to perform optimal searches as well.

### Encryption vs Hashing

- If you encrypt a file, you can decrypt it and get the original file back.
- If you hash a file, you can't get the original file back.

### Why?

It is because hashing maps a large set of data to a smaller set.

### How?

Suppose you have 1,2,....10^5 numbers and you want to store them under 100 buckets. You can use the following function to map the numbers to the buckets.

`f(x) = x % 100`

2%100 and 102%100 will both be 2. So, 2 will be stored in the same bucket as 102.

*Multiple value can be mapped to a single value, hence we can't get back the larger values from a single value*

### Why do we need hashing?

- Using hashing we can optimize a lot of algorithms.

### Components of Hashing

- Hash Function
- collision
- collision resolution technique
