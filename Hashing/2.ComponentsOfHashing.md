### Components of Hashing
- Hash Function
- collision
- collision resolution technique

### Hash Function
The hash function is used to transform the key into the the hashed value.

Key -> Input
Hashed Value -> Output

Given a collection of elements a hash function maps *each item to a unique hashed value then it is called a perfect hash function.*

### Hashtable

This a data structure that works on the principle of hashing.

*It is a DS that stores key-value pairs.*
We can also treat arrays as a hashtable.

Consider the following:
Given an algorithm to print first repeating element in a dataset.

```javascript
//Assume that the dataset is an array are ASCII characters, so total different characters are 256.

// create an array of size 256 and initialize it with 0

// array -> on xth index of a character we will store the number of times it has appeared in the dataset.

function firstRepeatingElement(arr){
    let hashTable = new Array(256).fill(0);
    for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
        if(hashTable[arr[i]] === 0){
            hashTable[arr[i]] = 1;
        }else{
            return arr[i];
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

**Hashtables are arrays of linked lists**
