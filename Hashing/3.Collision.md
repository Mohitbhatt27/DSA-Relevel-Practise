### Collision

Hash functions are used to map each key to a different address space, but practically it's not possible. That leads to collisions.

*Collision is a situation where two different keys are mapped to the same address space.*

### Basic hash functions

- `f(x) = x % z`, where z is generally a prime number.

- Hashing a string -> ASCII of each character is added and then modulo is taken.

- Mid Square method -> 
    1. Square the value of key, k.
    2. Extract middle r digits from the square.
    3. Use the extracted digits as the hash value.

    Pro - very fast
        - result is not dominated by the distribution of some specific digits. 
    Cons - Collisions can increase as a lot of squares can lead to the same middle digits.

- Digit Folding method -> 
    1. Break the key into equal sized pieces (the last piece may not be of equal size).
    2. Add the pieces.
    3. Use the sum as the hash value.

    Pro - very fast
        - result is not dominated by the distribution of some specific digits. 
    Cons - Collisions can increase as a lot of squares can lead to the same middle digits.
