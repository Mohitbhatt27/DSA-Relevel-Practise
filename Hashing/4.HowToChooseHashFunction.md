### How to choose a hash functions

- An efficient hash function should be designed so that it distributes the keys uniformly across the hash table.

- An efficient collision resolution technique should be designed so that it computes a alternative value during collision. 

- The hash function should be fast to compute with minimum collisions.

- The hash function should be easy to implement.
