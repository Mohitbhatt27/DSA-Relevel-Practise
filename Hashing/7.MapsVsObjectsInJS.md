# Maps

## Description

A Map object iteractes its elements in the order of insertion. 

We can use a for...of loop to iterate over the key-value pairs in a Map.

## Syntax

```javascript
new Map([iterable])
```
## JS objects and Maps

- Maps are iterable, while objects are not.

- Maps does not contain any keys by default whereas objects contain a default key called `__proto__`. _Every object in JS has an inbuilt property called it’s prototype. The prototype is itself an object, and it is an object then it will have it’s own prototype. It leads to a chain of prototypes. The chain ends, when we reach a prototype that has null for it’s own prototype._ we try to access a property of an object, if the property is present then we access it, but if it is not present then we search for the property in this prototype chain.


- Map keys can be any value whereas the keys of an object are always strings or symbols.

- The keys in Map are ordered in the order of insertion while keys added to object historically are not. Now they are. It's best not to rely on the property order of an object.

- The size of a Map can be easily found using the `size` property while the size of an object must be determined manually.

- A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.

- A map performs better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs while objects are not.
