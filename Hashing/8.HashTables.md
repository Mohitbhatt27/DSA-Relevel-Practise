# Hash Tables

    Hashtables are special data structure that can store key-value pairs.

    The whole key value pair is one complete entry.

    Hashtables work on the principle of hashing.

    Hashtables stores data in random order. The ordering is never going to be in the order of insertion.

    Integer keys are stored in ascending orders.
    String keys are stored in order of insertion.
    Symbol keys are stored in order of insertion.

    Internally, hashtables are implemented as array of linked lists.
    Each index of the array is called as a bucket index.
 _Hashtables for operations like insert, delete, find, etc. uses the mechanism of hashing. TC-> Î¸(1) for all operations._

    Hashtables have their dedicated hashing functions that takes input and for the input they generate a bucket index.
    The moment we get the bucket index we go to the array index pointed by the bucket index and insert our data into corresponding linked list.

_Hash function should return output in the range [0, n-1] where n is the size of the array._
