### Lambda factor / load factor
    It is the ratio of number of elements in the hashtable to the size of the hashtable.

    lambda = n/m

    n -> number of elements in the hashtable
    m -> size of the hashtable

    It defines how much the hashtable is full.

    let's say inside the hashtable we have 5 buckets, and we have 3 elements in the hashtable.
    Then lambda = 3/5 = 0.6

    Inside hashtables, actual data resides inside the nodes of the linked list.

    The hash function generally works in constant time. If there are string keys it will take O(n) time. n is the length of the string.

    Using the hash function we calc. the B.I. for any pair of key-value pair.

    Then we go to the BI and stre the lement in LL.

    But we try to keep the lambda factor as low as possible, around approx. 0.5.

If while inserting we exceed the load factor, then we do rehashing.

In rehashing we create a new array of double size and then from our old array of LL, we one by one insert elements inside the new array through LL.

*Because our load factor is going to be around 0.5, the linked lists are going to be very small. And hence searching an element is also going to be constant time operation on average*
