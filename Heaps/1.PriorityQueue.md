### Queue

In basic queues, an element which was added first is accessed/used/removed first. Here, the parameter of comparison is the time instance when an element is added.

### Priority Queue

In priority queues, an element with the highest priority is accessed/used/removed first. Here, the parameter of comparison is the priority of the element.
eg. If we add N products in a queue and want to access the one with highest rating, we can use a priority queue.

### Applications of Priority Queue

1. OS algorithms
2. Develop a new sorting algorithm
3. Kth order statistics

Priority queues can be implemented using heaps, binary search trees, and linked lists.
