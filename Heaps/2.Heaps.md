### Heaps

- Heaps are data strutures that can arrange elements based on priority.
1. Binary Heaps
2. Fibonacci Heaps

#### Binary Heaps

- Binary Heaps are a special type of Binary Tree.
- Binary Heaps are only complete binary trees.
- The elem with the highest priority is always at the root.
- The elem with the lowest priority is always at the last leaf.
- The priority of a parent node of binary heap is always greater than or equal to the priority of its children.

#### Min Heap

- In a min heap, lesser the value of node, higher the priority.


#### Max Heap

- In a max heap, greater the value of node, higher the priority.
