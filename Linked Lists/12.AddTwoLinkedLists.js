 Given the heads of two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

l2 = [5,6,4]
Result: sum = 807; L = [7,0,8]

  let carry = 0; //carry must be either 0 or 1 because of 19 being the max

  //looping until carry is present or both lists have exhausted
 // carry == 1 is also needed in while to handle the corner case when both link have exhausted but there still is some carry still left

//l1=[9,9], l2=[1]	The sum could have an extra carry of one at the end, which is easy to forget.
