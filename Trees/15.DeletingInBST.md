### Deleting a node from a BST

There can technically be 3 cases when deleting a node from a BST:
1. The node is a leaf node (has no children)
2. The node has one child
3. The node has two children

The basic implementation of deleting a node from a BST is as follows:

a. We check if the root passed to us is null, if it is, we return null.
b. We check if the value of x is greater than our root's value, if so we recursively find in right subtree.
c. We check if the value of x is less than our root's value, if so we recursively find in left subtree.

*d. We check if the value of x is equal to our root's value. This is the node to be deleted. And we need to handle of the 3 cases mentioned on top.*

**Case 1: The node is a leaf node (has no children)**
- In this case, we simply delete the node and return null.

**Case 2: The node has one child**
- In this case, we return the that only child of the node. 
    - In temp, we will store that child.
    - We will delete the node.
    - We will return temp.
    
**Case 3: The node has two children**
- In this case, we find the minimum node on the right subtree, or the maximum node on the left subtree.
    - We will store that node's value in the root's value.
    - Now, there will be a duplicate value in the subtree, so we call the delete function recursively on the right/left subtree.
    - We will return the root.
