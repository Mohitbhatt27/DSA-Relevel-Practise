### LCA

Suppose a, and b are the two nodes in the tree for which we have to find the LCA.

Let curr be the current node in the tree where I am at.

There can be 4 cases:

### Case 1: If curr == a || curr == b
- here we have found the LCA at curr


### Case 2: If a -> leftSubtree && b -> rightSubtree || the opposite
- here we have found the LCA at curr


### Case 3: Both a and b -> leftSubtree || the opposite
- return LCA(curr.left, a, b)


### Case 4: Both a and b are not in the tree
- return null
